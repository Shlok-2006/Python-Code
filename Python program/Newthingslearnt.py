# print(" {} ".format()) is used to put the value assigned in the format() to the {} when printed
# using "{:.2f}".format() to get the decimal of a float at 2 decimal points.  Ex: 103.400089 will be converted to 103.40

# f"{value:.2f}": Directly formats the value to 2 decimal places. .... Here "value" is the output that should be printed.
# round(value, 2): Rounds the value to 2 decimal places but outputs a float without controlling the number of digits shown.
